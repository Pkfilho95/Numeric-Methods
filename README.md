# Numeric Methods

This repository contains Python code for solving various computational problems using numerical methods. The primary purpose of this repository is educational, aimed at learning and understanding the implementation of numerical algorithms. The code provided here is **not optimized** for performance but focuses on clarity and comprehension.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of numerical methods for solving problems such as:
- Solving linear systems of equations using methods like Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, and iterative methods like Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel.
- Numerical integration using techniques like the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule.
- Solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using methods like Euler's method and the Runge-Kutta family of methods.
- Root-finding methods like the bisection method, Newton-Raphson method, and the Secant method.
- Data visualization using Matplotlib to visualize results and gain insights.

## Dependencies

The code in this repository heavily relies on NumPy, a powerful tool for numerical computations in Python. NumPy provides efficient array operations, linear algebra routines, and mathematical functions that are essential for implementing numerical algorithms. Additionally, Matplotlib is used for data visualization.

## Usage

Each directory contains Python scripts that demonstrate the implementation of specific numerical methods. You can navigate through the directories, examine the code, and run the examples to observe how these methods work.

To run the code, you'll need to have Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib installed on your system. You can install NumPy and Matplotlib using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
